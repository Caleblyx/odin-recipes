        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Hmmmm..... Bread.... A classic. Good bread features both a crusty exterior and a fluffy interior. It is both versatile and delicious on its own. Most importantly, it is simple to make. Follow the guide below to get started.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>5-6 cups bread flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, dissolve the sugar in warm water and then stir in yeast. Allow to proof until yeast resembles a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix salt and oil into the yeast. Mix in flour one cup at a time.</li>
            <li>Knead dough for 7 minutes. Place in a well oiled bowl, and turn dough to coat. Cover with a damp cloth. Allow to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Punch dough down. Knead for 1 minute and divide in half. Shape into loaves and place into two greased 9Ã—5 inch loaf pans. Allow to rise for 30 minutes, or until dough has risen 1 inch above pans.</li>
            <li>Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30-40 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cool, brush with butter and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
