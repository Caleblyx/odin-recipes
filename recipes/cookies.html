        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Everyone loves cookies and they are easy to make. This recipe guide teaches you how to make a delicious batch of cookies from scratch.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups (380 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>2 sticks (227 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups (247 grams) lightly packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
            <li>2 cups (340 grams) semi sweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350ºF. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In the bowl of an electric mixer beat the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the vanilla and eggs. Gradually beat in the flour mixture. Stir in the chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>If time permits, wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 24 hours but no more than 72 hours. This allows the dough to “marinate” and makes the cookies thicker, chewier, and more flavorful. Let dough sit at room temperature just until it is soft enough to scoop.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into 3-tablespoon sized balls using a large cookie scoop and drop onto prepared baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool for 5 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Although I prefer cookies fresh from the oven, these can be stored in an airtight container for up to 5 days. </li>
        </ol>
